1 - A hypothetical situation that would be illegal but ethical would be disclosing information about the government spying on its people, like Edward Snowden did, but hypothetical. An action that would be legal but unethical would be selling user information to other companies.

2 - A somewhat recent example would be Netflix testing out their methods of stopping password sharing.

3 - I believe it should be allowed in third-world countries, so long as the pirates are not selling the product as their own. Things like Microsoft Office can be seen as almost essential, so it would be cruel to force people that are already in a bad place to have to pay for these things.

4 - I don't really believe ethics training can be effective in changing employee behavior unless it is actually engaging in some way. Most people are stuck in their ways, I saw it at my long term maintenance job quite a bit.

5 - I would just tell a lie. I would say something along the lines of, "I've already told a few people that I would be okay with being interviewed for their reviews. I don't want it to look suspicious if I'm doing this for half of the department." I would just stick to that and do my best not to give in, because a lie about someone's performance is more unethical in my opinion than a small lie to avoid hurting someone's feelings.

6 - It's possible that this conversation would have given a competitive advantage to this supplier. Just based on the videos I used to have to watch about workplace ethics, I think the right answer here is to talk to my direct manager about the conversation. It would be best to just be honest and say something like, "I did not realize who they were and thought I was just having a chat with someone interested in my line of work." 

7 - I would never lie about things like whether or not I worked an actual job in my field, nor would I lie about any knowledge I hold. I would potentially word it in a vague way that might give the assumption that I have done more than I actually have, but only if it's something that I am confident that I can show that experience in.

8 - I'd say no, unless there's something that is actually justifiable. The issue with that is that it's subjective. So we'll go with no.

9 - 
a) IBM could easily justify the start of its sustainability programs in the 70s for many reasons, three of which being: The backlash from the unethical usage of carcinogens in production, the ability to be ahead of the curve (and eventually the leader) for ethical manufacturing processes, and to improve their image in the public eye.
b) IBM has achieved some massive goals such as cooperating with ISO in order to make new standards of environmentally conscious practices for manufacturing and reducing their own resource usage, growing their percentage of recycled materials, and lowering their electrical usage.
c) IBM can easily leverage its leadership by having a head start on conforming to practices put in place by ISO, especially since IBM is most likely spearheading those practices anyways.
